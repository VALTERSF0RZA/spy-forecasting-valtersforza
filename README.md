# SPY LSTM Forecasting with TensorFlow

This project forecasts SPY (S&P 500 ETF) using a Bidirectional LSTM neural network built in TensorFlow/Keras. The model integrates historical OHLCV data, MAG7 equity prices, macroeconomic indicators, and technical indicators like RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
